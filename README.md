# kafka-producer-consumer

Simple CDC Application Development Project with Apache Kafka

This project includes two Spring Boot applications:

Application A: pulls data from MongoDB and sends it to Apache Kafka. (producer)

Application B: consumes this data from Kafka. (consumer)

## Setup
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bernabaris/producer-consumer.git
   ```
2. Add consumer and producer apps as maven project.

3. Start the Kafka and MongoDB services, use the following command.
   ```sh
   cd docker/kafka; docker compose up -d; cd ..
   cd mongodb; docker compose up -d; cd ../..
   ```
4. Create docker images.
   ```sh
   cd producer; docker build -t producer:1.0.0 .; cd ..
   cd consumer; docker build -t consumer:1.0.0 .; cd ..
   ```
5. You should see JAR files generated in both consumer/target and producer/target directories.

6. Use the data_generator.py Python script in the directory to generate a data in the cdc collection in MongoDB.
   ```sh
   cd data-generator
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   python3 data_generator.py; cd ..
   ```
7. You should see logs similar to the following in the producer and consumer applications, indicating successful data transfer.

This project was developed to learn Apache Kafka, thanks to my study coach. @tunahansezen ðŸ’«
